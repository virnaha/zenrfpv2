# System Prompt Integration Update

## Overview

The RFP analysis and response generation application has been updated to use a comprehensive system prompt that provides expert-level analysis with the precision of top consulting firms like McKinsey and Accenture.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Document Analysis Service (`src/lib/services/document-analyzer.ts`)

#### Updated System Prompt
- **Before**: Basic RFP analyst prompt
- **After**: Comprehensive expert analyst prompt with 20+ years of enterprise software procurement experience

#### New Analysis Structure
The analysis now extracts and structures:

1. **Critical Requirements Matrix**
   - Mandatory requirements (MUST have) with compliance mapping
   - Desired requirements (SHOULD have) with weight scores
   - Optional requirements (NICE to have)
   - Hidden requirements (implied but not stated)

2. **Evaluation Criteria Decoder**
   - Scoring methodology and weights
   - Decision-maker priorities (read between the lines)
   - Budget indicators and price sensitivity
   - Risk factors and compliance requirements

3. **Strategic Intelligence**
   - Incumbent vendor advantages (if any)
   - Political landscape and stakeholder dynamics
   - Timeline pressures and urgency indicators
   - Competitive positioning opportunities

4. **Win Theme Identification**
   - Primary value drivers for this customer
   - Pain points to address
   - Differentiators that matter most
   - Proof points needed

5. **Red Flags & Risks**
   - Unrealistic requirements
   - Conflicting specifications
   - Missing information gaps
   - Potential deal breakers

#### Enhanced Data Structure
- Added confidence scores (0.0-1.0) for each finding
- Structured JSON output with detailed analysis
- Comprehensive stakeholder analysis with influence levels and priorities
- Enhanced deadline tracking with urgency indicators

### 2. RFP Analyzer Component (`src/components/RFPAnalyzer.tsx`)

#### Updated UI Sections
- **Critical Requirements Matrix**: Color-coded mandatory, desired, optional, and hidden requirements
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Priority-based scoring with confidence indicators
- **Strategic Intelligence**: Budget indicators, incumbent analysis, and timeline pressures
- **Win Themes**: Value drivers, pain points, differentiators, and proof points
- **Red Flags & Risks**: Severity-based risk assessment with impact analysis
- **Enhanced Stakeholders**: Influence levels and priority mapping

#### Visual Enhancements
- Confidence score indicators throughout the interface
- Color-coded priority and severity levels
- Structured layout for better information hierarchy
- Enhanced stakeholder cards with influence and priority tags

### 3. OpenAI Service (`src/lib/services/openai-service.ts`)

#### Updated System Prompt for Response Generation
- **Before**: Basic RFP response writer
- **After**: Expert analyst leveraging comprehensive analysis insights

#### Enhanced Section Templates
All section templates now leverage the comprehensive analysis:

- **Executive Summary**: Leverages critical requirements matrix and win themes
- **Company Overview**: Addresses strategic intelligence and competitive positioning
- **Technical Approach**: Incorporates evaluation criteria and red flag mitigation
- **Project Timeline**: Addresses timeline pressures and critical deadlines
- **Team Structure**: Aligns with stakeholder priorities and evaluation criteria
