          Zenloop Technical Due Diligence - Platform Architecture
          
          TECHNOLOGY STACK:
          
          Backend Technologies:
          - Elixir/Phoenix: Primary language and framework for core backend services, chosen for exceptional concurrency and reliability for real-time processing
          - Python: AI/ML microservices and specialized data processing pipelines
          - PostgreSQL: Primary relational database with advanced partitioning strategies
          - ElasticSearch: Search engine for efficient text analysis and complex querying
          - Redis: In-memory data store for caching and real-time features
          
          Frontend Technologies:
          - React: Primary framework for modern UI components and interactive dashboards
          - TypeScript: Type-safe JavaScript development
          - Ember.js: Legacy framework for existing components (actively migrating to React)
          - Modern CSS with SCSS preprocessor
          - Recharts and D3.js for data visualization
          
          Infrastructure and DevOps:
          - Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform:
            * ECS for container orchestration
            * RDS for managed PostgreSQL databases
            * S3 for object storage
            * CloudFront for CDN services
            * CloudWatch for monitoring
            * CloudAMQP for queue management
          - Docker for containerization
          - GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation
          - Terraform for infrastructure as code
          - Sentry for error tracking and performance monitoring
          
          AI and Machine Learning:
          - Azure OpenAI for advanced natural language processing
          - Custom Python ML pipelines for domain-specific analysis
          - TensorFlow for specialized machine learning models
          - scikit-learn for traditional machine learning algorithms
          
          Integration and APIs:
          - RESTful APIs following OpenAPI specifications
          - GraphQL for data-intensive client applications
          - WebSockets for real-time features
          - OAuth 2.0 and JWT for authentication
          
          Security Technologies:
          - AWS Security services (GuardDuty, Config, CloudTrail)
          - Automated vulnerability scanning
          - Dependabot for dependency security management
          - HTTPS/TLS for all communications
          
          PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE:
          
          Microservices Architecture:
          - Survey management service
          - Rendering service  
          - Analysis service
          - Feedback analysis service
          - Report creation service
          - User Access Management (UAM)
          
          Data Flow:
          1. Survey responses stored in PostgreSQL (source of truth)
          2. Indexed into ElasticSearch for searching and analysis
          3. Processing pipeline analyzes text, assigns topics, extracts sentiment
          4. Results available via RESTful APIs and dashboards
          
          Deployment Infrastructure:
          - Services containerized using Docker
          - CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions
          - Three environments: Development, Staging, Production
          - AWS infrastructure: ELB, ECS Cluster, RDS PostgreSQL, S3 storage
          - Monitoring: CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana
          
          COMPLEXITY AREAS:
          
          1. PostgreSQL-ElasticSearch Synchronization: Sophisticated handling of race conditions and edge cases during reindexing
          
          2. Multi-language Support: Text analysis pipeline for numerous languages adds complexity to codebase and testing
          
          3. Legacy Ember Components: Coexistence with React creates integration challenges (actively migrating to React)
          
          4. Partitioning Strategy: PostgreSQL partitioning improves performance but adds query optimization complexity
          
          5. Integration Complexity: Numerous third-party integrations introduce potential external failure points
          
          MITIGATION STRATEGIES:
          - Comprehensive automated testing, especially for data synchronization
          - Detailed developer documentation
          - Incremental legacy code modernization
          - Regular monitoring of critical integration points
          
          FRAMEWORK SUPPORT:
          
          Frontend Integration:
          - Platform uses React and legacy Ember internally
          - Framework-agnostic JavaScript widget for customer integration
          - RESTful APIs for integration with any frontend framework
          - WebSocket support for real-time updates
          
          Performance Characteristics:
          - Real-time data processing pipeline using Elixir
          - Modular, API-first architecture
          - Machine learning pipeline for language detection, topic assignment, sentiment analysis
          - Efficient handling of large-scale, multi-staged survey data
