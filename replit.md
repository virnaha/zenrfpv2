# RFP Analyzer Application

## Project Overview
This is a React-based RFP (Request for Proposal) Analyzer application built with:
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: ShadCN UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Build Tool**: Vite

## Current Status
- ✅ Successfully imported from GitHub
- ✅ Dependencies installed and configured
- ✅ Development server running on port 5000
- ✅ Deployment configuration set up for production
- ⚠️ Running in demo mode (requires API keys for full functionality)

## Architecture
The application includes:
- RFP upload and analysis functionality
- Company document management
- Response generation capabilities
- Modern React component architecture with TypeScript

## Configuration
- **Development Server**: Runs on `0.0.0.0:5000`
- **Host Configuration**: Properly configured for Replit environment with `allowedHosts: true`
- **Deployment**: Configured for autoscale deployment with build step

## Environment Variables (Optional)
The app runs in demo mode by default. For full functionality, these environment variables can be configured:
- `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API integration
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase database URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key
- `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Supabase service role key

## Recent Changes
