Build a comprehensive system that learns from historical RFPs, successful responses, and internal documents to intelligently analyze and respond to new RFPs.

Requirements:

1. Create an RFPAnalyzer class with these core capabilities:
   - analyzeHistoricalRFP(document, metadata) - extracts patterns from past RFPs
   - extractWinningPatterns(rfp, outcome) - learns from successful proposals
   - mapQuestionVariations(questions[]) - identifies similar questions across RFPs
   - buildKnowledgeGraph(documents[]) - creates relationship map
   - predictRequirements(newRFP) - anticipates unstated needs

2. Implement Document Intelligence Pipeline:
   
   A. Document Ingestion & Classification:
   - Auto-detect document type (RFP, RFP Response, Technical Doc, Case Study, Pricing Sheet)
   - Extract metadata (client, industry, deal size, win/loss status)
   - Identify document sections (requirements, evaluation criteria, submission guidelines)
   - Parse scoring rubrics and weightings
   - Extract compliance requirements and mandatory criteria
   
   B. Knowledge Extraction:
   - Question-Answer pair extraction from previous RFPs
   - Winning response patterns identification
   - Common objections and how they were addressed
   - Pricing strategies that won
   - Technical requirements patterns by industry
   - Compliance requirements by region/sector
   
   C. Pattern Recognition:
   - Identify recurring question themes across RFPs
   - Detect industry-specific terminology and requirements
   - Map question variations to canonical forms
   - Track requirement evolution over time
   - Identify deal-breakers and must-haves

3. Build Knowledge Base Structure:
   
   A. Create these data models:
   - knowledge_entries: validated facts from documents
   - question_patterns: common question types and variations
   - winning_responses: successful answer templates
   - client_preferences: learned preferences by client/industry
   - evaluation_criteria: how RFPs are typically scored
   - competitive_intelligence: differentiators that win
   
   B. Relationship Mapping:
   - Question → Best Response mapping
   - Requirement → Solution mapping
   - Industry → Common Requirements mapping
   - Client → Historical Preferences mapping
   - Feature → Benefit → Proof Point chains

4. Implement Learning Mechanisms:
   
   A. Continuous Learning:
   - updateKnowledgeBase(newDocument, metadata) - incremental learning
   - reinforceLearning(response, outcome) - learn from wins/losses
   - extractLessonsLearned(project) - post-mortem analysis
   - calibrateConfidence(predictions, actuals) - improve accuracy
   
   B. Quality Scoring:
   - scoreResponseRelevance(response, requirements) - how well it fits
   - calculateWinProbability(response) - based on historical data
   - identifyGaps(response, bestPractices) - what's missing
   - suggestImprovements(response) - specific enhancements
   
   C. Feedback Loop:
   - Track which suggested responses were used
   - Monitor which responses led to wins
   - Identify which knowledge base entries are most valuable
   - Deprecate outdated information automatically

5. Create Analysis Tools:
   
   A. Similarity Analysis:
   - findSimilarRFPs(newRFP, threshold) - finds comparable past RFPs
   - extractCommonRequirements(similarRFPs[]) - shared needs
   - identifyUniqueRequirements(newRFP) - what's different
   - suggestResponseStrategy(analysis) - recommended approach
   
   B. Competitive Intelligence:
   - extractCompetitorMentions(documents[]) - who else is bidding
   - identifyDifferentiators(ourSolution, market) - unique value props
   - analyzeWinLossReasons(historicalData) - why we win/lose
   - recommendPositioning(competitiveLandscape) - how to position
   
   C. Risk Assessment:
   - identifyRedFlags(rfp) - problematic requirements
   - assessComplexity(requirements) - effort estimation
   - flagComplianceRisks(rfp, ourCapabilities) - what we can't do
   - calculateResponseEffort(rfp) - time/resource needs

6. Build the Knowledge Query Interface:
   
   A. Intelligent Retrieval:
   - queryKnowledgeBase(question, context) - smart search
   - getRelevantPrecedents(requirement) - similar past cases
   - findSupportingEvidence(claim) - proof points
   - suggestCaseStudies(requirement) - relevant examples
   
   B. Response Generation Pipeline:
   - Generate initial response from templates and knowledge base
   - Enrich with specific examples from historical wins
   - Add client-specific customizations based on past interactions
   - Include competitive differentiators
   - Validate against compliance requirements
   
   C. Multi-document Reasoning:
   - Cross-reference information across multiple documents
   - Resolve conflicting information with confidence scores
   - Synthesize comprehensive answers from multiple sources
   - Maintain citation tracking for all claims

7. Implement Analytics Dashboard:
   
   A. Knowledge Base Metrics:
   - Total documents processed
   - Knowledge entries extracted
   - Question patterns identified
   - Win rate by response type
   - Most valuable knowledge sources
   
   B. Performance Tracking:
   - Response accuracy over time
   - Win rate improvement
   - Time saved per RFP
   - Knowledge base coverage gaps
   - User feedback scores
   
   C. Insights Generation:
   - Trending requirements in RFPs
   - Emerging compliance needs
   - Competitive landscape changes
   - Success pattern analysis
   - Recommended knowledge base additions

8. Create Workflow Integration:
   
   A. New RFP Analysis Workflow:
   1. Upload new RFP → Auto-analyze against knowledge base
   2. Identify similar past RFPs → Show win/loss outcomes
   3. Extract all requirements → Map to our capabilities
   4. Flag gaps and risks → Suggest mitigation strategies
   5. Generate response outline → Based on winning patterns
   6. Provide section-by-section guidance → With examples
   
   B. Knowledge Base Update Workflow:
   1. Upload new document → Classify and extract knowledge
   2. Validate extracted information → Human review interface
   3. Merge with existing knowledge → Handle conflicts
   4. Update patterns and templates → Improve future responses
   5. Notify relevant team members → About new insights

9. Add Advanced Features:
   
   - Industry-specific knowledge bases (healthcare, finance, tech, etc.)
   - Multi-language support for global RFPs
   - Automated compliance checking against regulations
   - Integration with CRM for client history
   - Collaborative annotation and knowledge validation
   - Version control for knowledge base entries
