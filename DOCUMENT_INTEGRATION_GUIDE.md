## **Common Causes & Fixes**

### 1. **Incorrect `base` Path in Vite Config**
- If your app is not at the root (e.g., deployed to `/insight-response-gen/`), you need to set the `base` in `vite.config.ts`.
- For Vercel, the default is usually fine (`'/'`), but if you changed it, set it back to `'/'`.

**Check your `vite.config.ts`:**
```ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ...other config
  base: '/',
});
```

---

### 2. **Build Output Directory**
- Vercel expects the build output to be in the `dist` folder.
- Make sure your build command is `vite build` or `npm run build` and the output is `dist`.

---

### 3. **404 on Refresh or Routing Issues**
- If you use React Router, you need a fallback for SPA routing.
- On Vercel, add a `vercel.json` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```

---

### 4. **Check for Build Errors**
- Go to your Vercel dashboard, open your project, and check the latest deployment logs for errors or warnings.

---

### 5. **Check Console Errors**
- Open your browser’s developer tools (F12) and check the Console and Network tabs for errors (e.g., 404s for JS/CSS files).

---

## **What to Do Next**

1. **Check your `vite.config.ts` for the correct `base` setting.**
2. **If you use React Router, add the `vercel.json` rewrite above.**
3. **Check Vercel build logs for errors.**
4. **Check browser console for errors and let me know what you see.**

The root cause of your blank page is almost certainly missing environment variables. Your codebase requires several Vite environment variables (like `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, etc.) to be set at build time. If these are missing, the app will not render and may show a blank page—even if there are no errors in the Vercel logs.

## **How to Fix**

### 1. **Add Environment Variables in Vercel**
1. Go to your project in the [Vercel dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard).
2. Click on your project (`insight-response-gen`).
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**.
4. Add all required variables:
   - `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - (and any others your app needs, as seen in your config files)
5. Redeploy your project.

### 2. **(Optional) Create a `.env` File Locally**
If you want to test locally, create a `.env` file in your project root with the same variables:
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```
*(Replace the values with your actual keys.)*

---

## **Summary**
- Your app is blank because it requires environment variables that are not set on Vercel.
- Add the required variables in the Vercel dashboard and redeploy.
- The app should work after that!
