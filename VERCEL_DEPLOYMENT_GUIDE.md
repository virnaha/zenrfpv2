# Vercel Deployment Guide

## üö® Critical Security Issue Fixed

Your OpenAI API key was exposed in the repository. This has been fixed by:
- Replacing the actual API key with a placeholder
- Ensuring .env files are properly ignored in .gitignore

## üîß Vercel Environment Variables Setup

To deploy your RFP Generator to Vercel, you need to configure environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:

### Required Environment Variables

1. **Go to your Vercel project dashboard**
2. **Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
3. **Add the following variables:**

#### OpenAI Configuration
```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-your-actual-api-key-here
VITE_OPENAI_MODEL = gpt-4-turbo-preview
VITE_OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS = 4000
VITE_OPENAI_TEMPERATURE = 7
VITE_OPENAI_ORGANIZATION = (leave empty unless you have one)
```

#### Feature Flags
```
VITE_ENABLE_AI_GENERATION = true
VITE_ENABLE_REAL_TIME_COLLABORATION = false
VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS = true
```

#### API Configuration
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://insight-response-gen.vercel.app/api
VITE_API_TIMEOUT = 30000
VITE_API_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS = 100
VITE_API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW = 60000
```

#### Supabase Configuration (Optional)
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL = (your-supabase-url-if-using)
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = (your-supabase-anon-key-if-using)
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = (your-supabase-service-key-if-using)
```

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Push changes to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select your project: `insight-response-gen`
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add all the variables listed above

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Vercel will automatically redeploy when you push to main
   - Or manually trigger a redeploy from the Vercel dashboard

## üîí Security Best Practices

- ‚úÖ Never commit API keys to the repository
- ‚úÖ Use Vercel's environment variables for sensitive data
- ‚úÖ Keep .env files in .gitignore
- ‚úÖ Use different API keys for development and production

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "OpenAI API key is required" error
**Solution:** Make sure `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is set in Vercel environment variables

### Issue: API calls failing
**Solution:** Check that all environment variables are properly configured

### Issue: Build failures
**Solution:** Ensure all required environment variables are set before building

## üìù Testing Your Deployment

1. Visit your deployed app: https://insight-response-gen.vercel.app
2. Try the RFP Analyzer feature
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify AI features are working with your API key

## üîÑ Updating Environment Variables

To update environment variables:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
2. Update the values
3. Redeploy the project

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Vercel deployment logs
2. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
